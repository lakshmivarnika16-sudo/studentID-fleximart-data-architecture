SECTION-A 
Limitations of RDBMS (Relational Databases)
Relational databases like MySQL work well when data is structured and consistent, but they struggle with highly diverse and evolving product data. In FlexiMart’s case, products such as laptops, shoes, and furniture have very different attributes. In an RDBMS, this requires adding many optional columns or creating multiple related tables, making the schema complex and inefficient.

Frequent schema changes are another limitation. Every time a new product type is introduced with new attributes, the database schema must be altered. These schema changes can be risky, time-consuming, and may cause downtime in production systems.

Additionally, storing customer reviews is challenging in relational databases. Reviews are naturally nested data (ratings, comments, timestamps, user details). In RDBMS, this requires multiple tables and joins, which increases query complexity and reduces performance when fetching product details along with reviews.



SECTION-B
Benefits of NoSQL (MongoDB)
MongoDB solves these challenges by using a flexible, document-based data model. Each product can be stored as a JSON-like document, allowing different products to have different attributes without changing the overall schema. For example, a laptop document can store RAM and processor details, while a shoe document can store size and color.

MongoDB also supports embedded documents, which makes it ideal for storing customer reviews directly inside product documents. This reduces the need for joins and allows faster retrieval of complete product information along with reviews.

Another major advantage is horizontal scalability. MongoDB can easily scale across multiple servers using sharding, making it suitable for handling large volumes of product data and high traffic as FlexiMart grows.



SECTION-C
Trade-offs of Using MongoDB
One major disadvantage of using MongoDB instead of MySQL is weaker relational integrity. MongoDB does not enforce foreign key constraints like relational databases. This means relationships between collections (such as products and orders) must be handled at the application level, increasing the risk of inconsistent or orphaned data if not managed carefully.


Another drawback is complex analytical querying. MongoDB is not as efficient as SQL databases for complex joins, aggregations, and reporting queries. Business intelligence tasks, financial reporting, and multi-table analytics are easier and more optimized in relational databases. Additionally, MongoDB requires careful schema design to avoid data duplication, which can increase storage usage.
Conclusion: MongoDB is suitable for FlexiMart where flexible schemas, nested product reviews, and scalability are required.This analysis supports the use of MongoDB for scalable retail applications.
